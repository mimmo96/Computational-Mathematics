(P1), (P2), … are any optimization or numerical analysis problems for which solution algorithms can be implemented using the techniques we have seen in the course (if more than one problem is selected, they should be related somehow).

(A1), (A2), … are any algorithms (optimization or numerical analysis) suitable for solving the problems (P1), (P2), … that have been seen in the course, or are at least based on the same conceptual tools.
